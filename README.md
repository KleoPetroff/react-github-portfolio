## Getting Started

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/33ba1eed7e1e438cbf3a1a277140a7a8)](https://app.codacy.com/app/KleoPetroff/react-github-portfolio?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=KleoPetroff/react-github-portfolio&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

The project uses the Github API and utilizes the browser's localStorage for persistence. The following instructions will give you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

### How to build

1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Install all dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the project by running `npm start`.

### Prettier and Precommit Hooks

Prettier is used for automatic code formatting. It's executed on every commit using a precommit hook.
